Sometimes it can be a small change like adding an extra meal along the itinerary. Sometimes the change may result in us altering the tour for the coming year. Ultimately, our goal is to provide you with the most rewarding experience. Please note that our brochure is usually released in November each year. If you have booked from the previous brochure you may find there have been some changes to the itinerary. \r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you print a final copy of your Trip Details to review a couple of days prior to travel, in case there have been changes that affect your plans.","detail_type":{"id":"79","label":"Dossier Disclaimer"}},{"body":"While it is our intention to adhere to the route described below, there is a certain amount of flexibility built into the itinerary and on occasion it may be necessary, or desirable to make alterations.

RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between June 18th and July 17th, 2015. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.

While not being guides in the traditional sense you can expect them to have a broad general knowledge of the countries visited on the trip, including historical, cultural, religious and social aspects.

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Included breakfasts in some places may be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs.

Some travellers may drink more than others while other travellers like to purchase more souvenirs than most. Please consider your own spending habits when it comes to allowing for drinks, shopping and tipping. Please also remember the following specific recommendations when planning your trip.","detail_type":{"id":"37","label":"Spending Money"}},{"body":"During this tour the local currency you will use is the Malaysian Ringgit. As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. The best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. USD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. Travellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!","detail_type":{"id":"36","label":"Money Exchange"}},{"body":"Please also make sure you have access to at least an additional USD $250 (or equivalent) as an 'emergency' fund, to be used when circumstances outside our control (ex. a natural disaster) require a change to our planned route.

Tipping is expected - though not compulsory - and shows an expression of satisfaction with the people who have assisted you on your tour. Although it may not be customary to you, it is of considerable significance to the people who will take care of you during your travels. There are several times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO will offer to collect the money and tip as a group. Recommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from $1.5-$3.5 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. Also at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job, tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $20-25 USD per person, per week can be used.","detail_type":{"id":"41","label":"Tipping"}},{"body":"Optional Activities not included in the trip itinerary. \r\nTunku Abdul National Marine park (Kota Kinabalu) - USD10\r\nKota Kinabalu Bird Sanctuary (Kota Kinabalu) - USD4\r\nRiver rafting full day (day trip from Kota Kinabalu) - USD70\r\nCamera Fee (Sepilok) - USD4\r\nRainforest Discovery Centre (Sepilok) - USD4\r\n\r\nAll prices are per person (unless stated otherwise), and are subject to change as services are provided by third party operators.","detail_type":{"id":"40","label":"Optional Activities"}},{"body":"Please note inoculations may be required for the country visited.

We recommend that you carry a First Aid kit and hand sanitizers / antibacterial wipes as well as any personal medical requirements. Please be aware that sometimes we are in remote areas and away from medical facilities, and for legal reasons our CEO's are prohibited from administering any type of drug including headache tablets, antibiotics, etc. In Asia pharmacies tend to stock the same western drugs as you get at home but they are usually produced locally so please bring the full drug name with you when trying to purchase a prescription drug. When selecting your trip please carefully read the brochure and itinerary and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please refer to the Physical and Culture Shock ratings for trip specific information.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time. If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

Travellers with a pre-existing medical condition are required to complete a short medical questionnaire, which must be signed by their physician. This is to ensure that travellers have the necessary fitness and mobility to comfortably complete their chosen trip. While our CEOs work hard to ensure that all our travellers are catered for equally, it is not their responsibility to help individuals who cannot complete the day's activities unaided.

Our philosophy of travel is one of respect towards everyone we encounter, and in particular the local people who make the world the special place it is. The exploitation of prostitutes is completely contrary to this philosophy.

We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects. If you have credit card insurance we require proof of purchase of the trip (a receipt of credit card statement) with a credit card in your name.

ACCOMMODATION\r\nIt should be stressed that the nature of the accommodation when compared with other areas of Southeast Asia, is sometimes of a lower standard than normally provided on G Adventures trips.

Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\n2. RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between May 27th and June 25th, 2017. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan.

It is to your advantage as you are expected to carry your own luggage, though distances are never great. We do not allow the use of video cameras when staying in the villages as it can be perceived by the local people as highly obtrusive. Most travellers carry their luggage in a pack, although an overnight bag with a shoulder strap would suffice. Suitcases are not appropriate for this particular trip! You need to bring your main piece of luggage as well as a small to medium backpack for overnight trips (30-35 litres/8-9 gallons). In this you will need to carry a change of clothes, torch/flashlight, toiletries, warm clothes and any other essentials.

An average level of physical fitness is required, athough stubborness (endurance) helps. Walk at your own pace – slow and steady is the way to go – DO NOT RUSH! The only reward for trying to prove something by being first is nausea, vomiting and a splitting headache. Go slowly – plod on at a steady pace, pause, standing to rest – don’t sit too often – it is harder to get going again. Don't worry about whether others are ahead, the path is clear and your guides keep track of where you are. There is plenty of time so walk at your pace regardless of how far behind you may think you are. Remember the sun is intense – wear sunscreen and sunglasses. It is colder than you think, especially in the wind – if you take off layers whilst walking make sure to put them on again as soon as you stop or are in the shade – don’t wait to get cold.","detail_type":{"id":"72","label":"Detailed Trip Notes"}},{"body":"Every traveller is different and therefore spending money requirements will vary. Some travellers may drink more than others while other travellers like to purchase more souvenirs than most. Please consider your own spending habits when it comes to allowing for drinks, shopping and tipping. Please also remember the following specific recommendations when planning your trip.","detail_type":{"id":"37","label":"Spending Money"}},{"body":"During this tour the local currency you will use is the Malaysian Ringgit. \r\nAs currency exchange rates in Southeast Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies.\r\nThe best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and  at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!","detail_type":{"id":"36","label":"Money Exchange"}},{"body":"Please also make sure you have access to at least an additional USD $200 (or equivalent) as an 'emergency' fund, to be used when circumstances outside our control (ex. a natural disaster) require a change to our planned route.

It is your responsibility to consult with your travel doctor for up to date medical travel information well before departure. \r\n\r\nYou should consult your doctor for up-to-date medical travel information well before departure. We recommend that you carry a First Aid kit and hand sanitizers / antibacterial wipes as well as any personal medical requirements. Please be aware that sometimes we are in remote areas and away from medical facilities, and for legal reasons our leaders are prohibited from administering any type of drug including headache tablets, antibiotics, etc. In Asia pharmacies tend to stock the same western drugs as you get at home but they are usually produced locally so please bring the full drug name with you when trying to purchase a prescription drug. When selecting your trip please carefully read the brochure and itinerary and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please refer to the Physical and Culture Shock ratings for trip specific information. G Adventures reserves the right to exclude any traveller from all or part of a trip without refund if in the reasonable opinion of our CEO they are unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nAltitudes are generally defined as follows:\r\n· High altitude 2,400m – 4,200m \r\n· Very high altitude 4,200m – 5,400m \r\n· Extreme altitude above 5,400m \r\n\r\nAltitude sickness is caused by the failure of the body to adapt to the reduced level of oxygen in the air at an increased altitude. During the trek it is likely that all climbers will experience at least some form of mild altitude sickness. Everyone reacts to altitude differently and altitude sickness can on set with people irrespective of fitness and age. Even the same person can react differently to altitude at different times.\r\n\r\nDanger signs to watch out for: The most common are headaches (although this can also be caused due to dehydration), light-headedness, nausea, loss of appetite, tingling in the extremities (toes, fingers) and a mild swell of ankles and fingers. Communicate any of these symptoms to your guide and follow their advice at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you have severe and consistent symptoms, don't go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. If they do not stop or at least reduce to a manageable level go to a lower altitude and see if your symptoms improve. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely. \r\n\r\nThere are medications available that help the body increase oxygen levels and reduce the effects of altitude sickness. Always check with your medical professional before using any medication. \r\n\r\nDon't ignore signs of altitude sickness. People can, and have, died of altitude sickness because of a failure to recognize the danger signs.","detail_type":{"id":"33","label":"Health"}},{"body":"Many national governments provide a regularly updated advice service on safety issues involved with international travel. We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

It is very important you are aware that an average level of fitness and mobility is required to undertake our easiest programs.

Travellers with a pre-existing medical condition are required to complete a short medical questionnaire, which must be signed by their physician. This is to ensure that travellers have the necessary fitness and mobility to comfortably complete their chosen trip. While our leaders work hard to ensure that all our travellers are catered for equally, it is not their responsibility to help individuals who cannot complete the day's activities unaided.

Our philosophy of travel is one of respect towards everyone we encounter, and in particular the local people who make the world the special place it is.

We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.
